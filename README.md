# Car-Price-Prediction
To model the prices of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by management to understand how exactly
the prices vary with the independent variables. Accordingly  manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels, the pricing dynamics for the new market.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing 
unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have 
contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factor on which the price of cars depends. 
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since 
those may be very different from the Chinese market. 

The company wants to know: 
● Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car. 
● How well those variables describe the price of a car. 
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars 
across the American market

OBJECTIVES:
You are required to model the prices of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by 
management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly 
manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model 
will be good for management to understand the pricing dynamics of the new market.
